On a very high level, the use cases on this page can be grouped into using standard desktop features to enable research workflows and using specific HPC features like the batch system. While the second ones are more interesting, the first ones should not be underestimated because they enable a convenient user environment.

# Using a Graphical File Manager
The ability to use a graphical file manager is a real game changer for new users in a Linux and HPC environment. While it is true that managing files on the command line only requires learning a few commands, in practice this puts a huge burden on new users. New users usually have only ever used a graphical file manager like the MacOS Finder or the Windows File Explorer, and the concept of "running a command to perform file actions" is foreign to them.  
Use cases enabled by a graphical file manager include:
- Easy unpacking of archive files by selecting a file with the mouse and selecting "Extract here" from the file’s context menu.
- Create an archive from a directory tree by selecting "Compress" from the directory’s context menu.
- Looking up how much storage is consumed by an entire directory tree by looking at directory properties or using a [disk usage analyzer tool](../ToolsAndApplications/README.md).
- Moving files from one storage location to another by using "Copy and Paste" or "Drag and Drop" (for example from HOME to SCRATCH).
- File deletion, through either moving file(s) to the "Trash", or right-clicking to choose "Delete" from a pop-up menu. Having a "Trash" facility that makes it easy for users to undelete a file.
- Bookmarking directories in the file manager allows users to easily remember the mount points for different file system, for example HOME, SCRATCH, PROJECT etc.
- Easily connect to "outside" storage location by using the "Connect to Server" functionality. This allows for easy data movement from Windows file shares as well as connecting to cloud storage providers.
