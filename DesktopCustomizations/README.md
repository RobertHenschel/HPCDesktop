# Desktop Customizations
This section contains ideas and implementations how to change a plain Linux desktop into a Research Desktop. This involves adding icons to the desktop and also modifying the global application menu. The goal is to provide users with a desktop that makes it easy to run scientific applications and workflows.  
Most of the tools are based on the [MATE Desktop Environment](https://mate-desktop.org/) but can be adapted for other desktop environments.

## Interactive Job
New users find it hard to run an interactive job in the batch system. One way to get users to try running in the batch system is to initially hide the functionality behind an icon on the desktop. Here is an animation how this could look like:
