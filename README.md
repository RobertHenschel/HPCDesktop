This repository builds on the work of organizations like [Research Technologies at Indiana University](https://kb.iu.edu/d/apum), [The Centre for Scientific and Technical Computing at Lund University](https://www.lunarc.lu.se/) and [The Computing Center at Denmark Technical University](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) that have used [ThinLinc](https://www.cendio.com/) to create a Research Desktop. 

# Desktop Customizations
[Here](./DesktopCustomizations/README.md) you find ideas and implementations how to modify a vanilla Linux desktop into a Research Desktop.

# Tools and Applications
[Here](./ToolsAndApplications/README.md) you find tools that help with building a Research Desktop or that users of Research Desktops will find useful.

# Use Cases for Research Desktops
Use cases for the Research Desktop can be loosely grouped into "standard desktop features to enable research workflows and tasks" and "specific tools for interfacing with HPC compute and storage systems and research infrastructure".

[This section](./UseCases/README.md) lists a large number of those seemingly obvious use cases, and highlights why those are surprisingly useful in an HPC environment.
