This repository builds on the work of organizations like [Research Technologies at Indiana University](https://kb.iu.edu/d/apum), [The Centre for Scientific and Technical Computing at Lund University](https://www.lunarc.lu.se/) and [The Computing Center at Denmark Technical University](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) that have used [ThinLinc](https://www.cendio.com/) to create a Research Desktop. 

# Desktop Customizations
[Here](./DesktopCustomizations/README.md) you find ideas and implementations how to modify a vanilla Linux desktop into a Research Desktop.

# Tools and Applications
[Here](./ToolsAndApplications/README.md) you find tools that help with building a Research Desktop or that users of Research Desktops will find useful.

# Publications about the Research Desktop
