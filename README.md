This repository is dedicated to the concept of using a Linux desktop as a user interface to a supercomputer or HPC system. Universities and Research labs around the world are already using this concept to lower the barrier of entry to HPC systems and attract new user groups. These organizations are leveraging investments in HPC compute and storage systems to serve a much wider audience and provide a superior user experience.

This repository builds on the work of organizations like [Research Technologies at Indiana University]([https://kb.iu.edu/d/apum](https://hdl.handle.net/2022/33757)), [The Centre for Scientific and Technical Computing at Lund University](https://www.lunarc.lu.se/) and [The Computing Center at Denmark Technical University](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) that have used [ThinLinc](https://www.cendio.com/) to create an HPC Desktop. 

# Executive Summary - HPC Desktop
What if you had **access to a high performance desktop from any endpoint device**? What if this desktop allowed you to **launch interactive graphical applications** like MATLAB, Jupyter Notebooks, Ansys and VS Code, as well as **compose scientific workflows** using graphical and command line tools What if this desktop had **enough performance to run the applications** and also provided tools to **quickly manage and submit jobs to an HPC system**? What if this desktop was **available to you for weeks or months**, allowing you to **reconnect whenever you need** it? This is what an HPC Desktop provides!

# Use Cases
Use cases for the HPC Desktop can be loosely grouped into "standard desktop features to enable research workflows and tasks" and "specific tools for interfacing with HPC compute and storage systems and research infrastructure".

[This section](./UseCases/README.md) lists a large number of those seemingly obvious use cases, and highlights why those are surprisingly useful in an HPC environment.

# Desktop Customizations
This [section](./DesktopCustomizations/README.md) contains ideas and implementations how to change a plain Linux desktop into an HPC Desktop. This involves adding icons to the desktop and also modifying the global application menu. The goal is to provide users with a desktop that makes it easy to run scientific applications and workflows.  
Most of the tools are based on the [MATE Desktop Environment](https://mate-desktop.org/) but can be adapted for other desktop environments.  

# Tools and Applications
[Here](./ToolsAndApplications/README.md) you find tools that help with building an HPC Desktop or that users of HPC Desktops will find useful.
